# ï¿½ Hybrid Vanish System Implementation

## âœ… What Was Implemented

### ðŸŽ¯ **Hybrid Vanish Architecture**
- **Plugin Message Integration** with Radium's `radium:vanish` channel for real-time updates
- **Level-based Visibility System** using VanishLevel enum (HELPER, MODERATOR, ADMIN, OWNER)
- **HTTP API Fallback** for compatibility and debugging
- **Real-time Entity Visibility** using Minestom's player visibility APIs
- **Permission-based Access Control** respecting Radium proxy permissions

### ðŸ”§ **Core Components Added**

#### 1. **VanishPluginMessageListener** (`listeners/VanishPluginMessageListener.kt`)
- Processes vanish plugin messages from Radium proxy in real-time
- Handles individual vanish state changes and batch updates
- Manages vanish data with levels, timestamps, and metadata
- Updates player entity visibility immediately upon vanish events

#### 2. **VanishModels** (`models/VanishModels.kt`)
- **VanishLevel** enum matching Radium's permission-based system
- **VanishData** class for tracking vanish state with metadata
- Permission checking logic and visibility rule enforcement
- Duration formatting and vanish metadata management

#### 3. **Enhanced VisibilityManager** (`features/visibility/VisibilityManager.kt`)
- **UPDATED**: `updatePlayerVisibilityForVanish()` - Now uses hybrid system
- **NEW**: Uses plugin message listener instead of HTTP API for vanish checks
- **NEW**: Respects VanishLevel permissions for visibility rules
- Minestom entity hiding/showing with proper permission checks

#### 4. **Enhanced TabListManager** (`features/tablist/TabListManager.kt`)
- **UPDATED**: Uses hybrid vanish system for tab list visibility
- **NEW**: Shows vanish indicators based on permission levels
- **NEW**: Real-time tab list updates via plugin messages
- Respects viewer permissions for vanished player visibility

#### 5. **Enhanced VanishTestCommand** (`commands/impl/VanishTestCommand.kt`)
- **COMPLETELY REWRITTEN** for hybrid system testing
- `/vanishtest status [player]` - Check detailed vanish status with levels
- `/vanishtest visibility [player]` - Test permission-based visibility
- `/vanishtest list` - List all vanished players with levels and durations
- `/vanishtest monitor` - Show hybrid system statistics
- `/vanishtest refresh` - Force refresh all vanish statuses

#### 6. **Legacy HTTP Monitor** (`features/vanish/VanishStatusMonitor.kt`)
- **KEPT**: For backup/fallback compatibility
- **UPDATED**: Now works alongside plugin message system
- Provides HTTP API polling as secondary monitoring system

### ðŸŽ® **System Integration**

#### **LobbyPlugin Updates**
- Added `VanishPluginMessageListener` to plugin lifecycle
- Integrated plugin message event registration with Minestom's GlobalEventHandler
- Added hybrid vanish components to initialization and shutdown sequences
- Proper cleanup handling for all vanish data on shutdown

#### **PlayerJoinListener Integration**
- Added vanish visibility updates on player join using hybrid system
- Ensures new players are properly shown/hidden based on current vanish states
- Automatic permission checking for visibility rules

#### **PlayerLeaveListener Cleanup**
- Removes players from vanish tracking when they disconnect
- Prevents memory leaks and stale vanish data
- Cleans up both plugin message and HTTP monitoring data

#### **ScoreboardManager Enhancement**
- Enhanced `updateScoreboard()` method for vanish events
- Refreshes scoreboards when players vanish/unvanish
- Respects permission-based visibility for scoreboard updates

#### **TabListManager Integration**
- **FULLY UPDATED** to use hybrid vanish system
- Shows permission-appropriate vanish indicators
- Real-time updates via plugin messages from Radium proxy

## ðŸ”¥ **Critical Functionality Achieved**

### âœ… **Hybrid Architecture (NEW)**
- **Primary**: Plugin messages from Radium proxy for instant updates
- **Secondary**: HTTP API polling for fallback and debugging
- **Real-time**: Vanish state changes processed within milliseconds
- **Permission-based**: VanishLevel system matching Radium exactly

### âœ… **Entity Visibility (ENHANCED)**
- **Vanished players are invisible** to unauthorized players based on permission levels
- **Staff with higher permission levels** can see lower level vanished players
- **`radium.vanish.see` permission override** works for all levels
- **Instant updates** when vanish status changes via plugin messages

### âœ… **Tab List Integration (UPDATED)**
- Tab list respects vanish levels and permission hierarchy
- Shows level-appropriate "(Vanished)" indicators for authorized viewers
- Hides vanished players from unauthorized viewers' tab lists
- Real-time updates via hybrid system

### âœ… **Real-Time Updates (IMPROVED)**
- **Instant**: Plugin message processing for immediate vanish changes
- **Reliable**: HTTP polling backup ensures no missed status changes
- **Efficient**: Batch update processing for performance
- **Accurate**: Permission-based visibility rules enforced consistently

### âœ… **Administrative Tools (ENHANCED)**
- Comprehensive testing command with level information
- Monitoring statistics for both plugin message and HTTP systems
- Force refresh capabilities for debugging
- Detailed vanish information including levels, duration, and metadata

## ðŸ”§ **Configuration**

All hybrid vanish features are controlled by config in `config.yml`:

```yaml
radium:
  vanish:
    respect_status: true      # Enable vanish integration
    hybrid_mode: true         # Use hybrid system (plugin messages + HTTP fallback)
    hide_from_tab: true       # Hide from tab list based on permissions
    cache_duration: 30        # Cache duration (seconds)

tablist:
  respect_vanish_status: true    # Respect vanish in tab list
  show_vanish_indicator: true    # Show (Vanished) indicator to authorized staff
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works**

### **Hybrid Architecture Flow:**
1. **Radium Proxy** sends plugin messages via `radium:vanish` channel when vanish state changes
2. **VanishPluginMessageListener** receives and processes these messages immediately
3. **VanishData** objects are created/updated with level, timestamp, and metadata
4. **VisibilityManager** uses Minestom's `addViewer()`/`removeViewer()` API with permission checks
5. **TabListManager** updates to show/hide players based on VanishLevel permissions
6. **HTTP Monitor** continues running as backup for debugging and fallback

### **Permission System:**
- **HELPER** level: Hidden from regular players
- **MODERATOR** level: Hidden from helpers and regular players
- **ADMIN** level: Hidden from all non-admins
- **OWNER** level: Hidden from everyone except other owners
- **`radium.vanish.see`**: Override permission to see ALL vanished players

## ðŸš€ **Testing Commands**

Use `/vanishtest` (requires `hub.vanishtest` permission):
- **`/vanishtest`** - Check your own vanish status
- **`/vanishtest status [player]`** - Check detailed vanish status with levels
- **`/vanishtest visibility [player]`** - Test if you can see a specific player
- **`/vanishtest list`** - List all vanished players you can see
- **`/vanishtest monitor`** - Show hybrid system statistics
- **`/vanishtest refresh`** - Force refresh all statuses (HTTP fallback)

## âœ… **What's Fixed & Enhanced**

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Plugin messages for instant updates + HTTP fallback
- **Permission Levels**: Complete VanishLevel system matching Radium exactly
- **Entity Visibility**: Players properly hidden/shown with permission checking
- **Tab List Integration**: Level-appropriate vanish indicators and visibility
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant processing via plugin messages
- **Administrative Tools**: Comprehensive testing and monitoring commands
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of vanish data on player disconnect
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout the hybrid system

The hybrid vanish system is now fully functional and matches Radium's architecture exactly! ðŸŽ‰
